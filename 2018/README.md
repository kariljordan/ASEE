## Abstract
Training for data skills is more critical now than ever before. In the past decade, we’ve seen the creation of certification and graduate programs for data science, as well as a plethora of interactive, self-paced online learning platforms. Today’s learners are often learning on the job and need the flexibility of short, or self-paced learning experiences. Research results, however, stress the importance of guided instruction and learner-instructor interaction. 

We’ve taken a distinctive approach to this problem, combining the power of guided instruction with the flexibility of short, focused learning experiences. Two-day, interactive, hands-on coding workshops train researchers to work with data, and have impacted over 27,500 researchers, ranging from biologists to physicists to engineers and economists. Researchers have benefited from evidence-based teaching approaches to learning data organization (spreadsheets), cleaning (OpenRefine), management (SQL), analysis and visualization (R and Python). 

This paper presents the long-term survey results showing the effect that these two-day impactful workshops have for increasing learner's skills and confidence in their coding practices. Results show these two-day coding workshops increase researcher’s daily programming usage, and sixty-five percent of respondents have gained confidence in working with data and open source tools as a result of completing the workshop. The long-term assessment data showed a decline in the percentage of respondents that 'have not been using these tools' (-11.1%), and an increase in the percentage of those who now use the tools on daily basis (14.5%). Implications and growth opportunities for teaching data science are also explored.
