There are two data files used in this paper's analyses:
+ 20170701 is the data file used in the original [long-term survey report](https://carpentries.github.io/assessment/carpentries/long-term-survey/report.html). The survey was sent out in March 2017 This survey included a dropdown for what Country respondents attended a workshop. This question was moved to the end of the survey so that we can ask demographic questions to U.S. respondents only.
